-- 10.	Write a SQL query linking each author to their probable political bias, based on the articles theyâ€™ve written.  
-- The table should contain three columns, the author name, the political bias, and the count of how many articles that author has published with that bias.  
-- Order the results alphabetically by author name, from greatest number of articles to least, and alphabetically by bias in the case of a tie.
